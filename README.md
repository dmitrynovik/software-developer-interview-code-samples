# HTTP / Web API (basic)

Assume I have made a request to a HTTP Web API created by someone 

    GET Customers/1

And receive the following response

    200
    
    {
        "Id": 0,
        "FirstName": null,    
        "LastName": null,
        "Message": "Customer not found"
    }

Do you see any problem with the response?


Next, assume I have made a request to a HTTP Web API created by someone 

    GET Customers/xyz

And receive the following response

    200
    
    {
        "Id": 0,
        "FirstName": null,    
        "LastName": null,
        "Message": "FormatException"
    }

Do you see any problem with the response?
